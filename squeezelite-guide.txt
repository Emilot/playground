#################### Unofficial Guide for Squeezelite in Archphile ####################

I have created squeezelite packages for the Rpi, Cubox and Udoo. However this is 100% 
unofficial and for testing purposes.

If you want to experiment do the following:


1. add the playground repo in /etc/pacman.conf

- for the Rpi:

[playground]
SigLevel = Never
Server = http://archphile.org/lab/playground/repos/playground-rpi

- for Cubox-i and Udoo

[playground]
SigLevel = Never
Server = http://archphile.org/lab/playground/repos/playground-arm7



2. install the package

pacman -Sy squeezelite-archphile



3. Stop and disable mpd and ympd

systemctl stop mpd ympd
systemctl disable mpd ympd



4. Edit the following file and put the ip of your Logitech media server:

nano /etc/conf.d/squeeze

for example if the logitech server has the ip 192.168.2.100

server=192.168.2.100
name=Archphile
logtype=all
loglevel=info
logfile=/var/log/squeezelite.log



5. start and enable the squeezlite service

systemctl start squeezelite
systemctl enable squeezelite



6. I can't believe that you disabled MPD/ympd in order to use squeezelite. 
   Come on, think twice! Just undo:

pacman -Rcsn squeezebox-archphile
systemctl start mpd ympd
systemctl enable mpd ympd

   

   and feel the power of MPD!
